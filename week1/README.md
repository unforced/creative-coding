This is the assignment for Week 1 of the "Creative Coding" class at CU Boulder.

I first made a very rudimentary "A" in the p5js editor, but then decided to get more advanced and to also use this as an opportunity to learn how to use cursor for more AI enhanced coding.

Most of the code written here is written by claude-3.5-sonnet using cursor, with a lot of prompting by me. In order to ensure that I was using AI as a support and not a hindrance, I had it regularly explain the code to me and comment in such a way that it supported me, a beginner, learning.

When viewed in a browser, you should see a colorful animation moving between two atlas "A"s.

To run, download the code and open `index.html` in your browser.
